***README:***

This project was rather long and extensive in duration, beginning in January with study on the human heart and how it operates, leading to research on ECG patterns.
It also required multiple technical and inter-disciplinary skills, combining computer science, engineering and medicine.
This further proves that no single discipline is carried out in isolation, rather, must borrow skills from other disciplines in order to make progress.
I hope this project is found useful, and can be improved upon in future iterations.
